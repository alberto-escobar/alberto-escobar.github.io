                Other users who receive encrypted content can use the app to decrypt and read the content with the correct key.
                CipherPad provides an effective means for someone to secure the contents of private notes and share encrypted versions of the note to others.
                This project was developed using Java, SQLite, and the android dev environment for IDEA. 
                An APK of the first release of the application is available for download at the download icon below.

            <div class="description">
                The Automatic Sorting System was the final project assigned for the mechatronics course (MECH458) offered at University of Victoria. 
                The goal of the project was to design and program a system that can successfully sort 48 objects into 4 different categories in under 60 seconds. 
                The objects were made from one of the following materials: black plastic, white plastic, aluminum, or steel. 
                These objects were categorized based on the material the system detected they were made of. 
                The system consisted of a conveyor belt with laser trip sensors and an IR reflectance sensor, a rotating sorting tray, and an Atmel 8-bit microcontroller (AT90USB1287).
                The final demo of the project successfully sorted 48 pieces in 38 seconds with 4 errors made.

            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Melanoma is a dangerous form of skin cancer that is often hard to diagnose early due to its similar looking nature to benign moles. 
                For this project a convolution neural network was developed and trained to help identify suspicious moles that may have melanoma. 
                The model outputs 10 labels which indicate presence of asymmetry, pigmentation network, regression areas, blue-whitish veil, and 6 colors. 
                The structure of the convolution neural network was optimized to determine a configuration that yielded the most suitable results. 
                The final model configuration consists of 3 convolution layers that have max pooling layers sandwiched in between, this is followed by 3 dense layers. 
                The training of the model used the PH2 data set which consists of 200 dermoscopic photos of moles along with description and diagnosis given by a dermatologist. 
                A modified version of the data set was created by performing horizontal and vertical reflections to produce a data set for validation. 
                Statistical analysis was performed on the model to determine accuracy and reliability of the label classification of the neural network.
